Grading
-------

Grading for this course is done on the basis of 2 exams and ~10 problem sets. Exams are not "open book", but you can bring one 2-sided, letter-sized sheet of mnemonic aids. For the exams, you'll probably need a very basic calculator.

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Problem sets | 30% |
| Mid-term exam | 30% |
| Final exam (during finals week) | 40% 

Collaboration Policy
--------------------

Before preparing your problem set, you are welcome to discuss it with your fellow students. Data and figures may not be shared. All writing in a problem set must be original: do not copy any portion from reference material or the problem sets of other students, previous or current.
